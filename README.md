# Tracker Resource

An output only resource that will deliver finished [Pivotal Tracker][tracker] stories that are linked in recent git commits.

[tracker]: https://www.pivotaltracker.com

## Usage

When you use the [Pivotal Tracker syntax for finishing a story or fixing a bug](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/api?version=v5#Tracker_Updates_in_SCM_Post_Commit_Hooks) this resource will detect it in your commit history and deliver the appropriate stories.

## Configuration

### Resource

``` yaml
- name: tracker-output
  type: tracker
  source:
    token: TRACKER_API_TOKEN
    project_id: "TRACKER_PROJECT_ID"
    tracker_url: https://www.pivotaltracker.com
```

Replace `TRACKER_API_TOKEN` and `TRACKER_PROJECT_ID` with your API token (which can be found on your profile page) and your project ID (which can be found in the URL of your project). Make sure that your project ID is a string because it will converted to JSON when given to the resource and JSON doesn't like integers.

You'll need a separate resource for each Tracker project.

### Build

``` yaml
- name: deploy
  plan:
  - get: git-repo-path
  - ...
  - put: tracker
    params:
      repos:
      - git-repo-path
```

#### Out Parameters

* `repos`: *Required.* Paths to the git repositories which will contain the delivering commits.

* `comment`: *Optional.* A file containing a comment to leave on any delivered stories.

* `delivered`: *Optional.* An option specifying whether to leave a comment on pre-delivered stories. Defaults to 'false'.
